THE BARHARA TRILOGY
V0.334

This patch is intended to implement Barhara Revisited, Julius's Revenge, and a secret third chapter into one rom.
As of the current version, only the FE8 port of Barhara Revisited is complete.

BARHARA REVISITED:
Sigurd has fought his way through many, many enemies. Finally, he reaches Barhara Castle, greeted by Duke Alvis of Velthomer. However, it was a trap. Sigurd is up for execution, and to make matters worse, Deirdre, Sigurd's missing wife, is standing at Alvis's side. What are you going to do?
In reality, Sigurd was killed by Alvis personally, and his army was pelted with massive meteors, killing many and scattering the remainder to the wind.
Can you correct this? Can Sigurd break through to his wife? Can you escape Alvis's trap? Can you right the wrongs of Barhara? That is why we're revisiting this fated battlefield of Genealogy of the Holy War's most iconic moment.

Changelog from FE7 1.0:
* Bad ending dramatically revamped
* The canon intermission has been added if Sigurd dies
* Azmure no longer calls for Sigurd if he visits Barhara
* More custom animations added
* Opening cutscene and death quote scripts taken from Reperation
* Jugdral music replaces vanilla tracks
* Additional hints at the objective given in the opening cutscene
* Barhara can now be properly visited, the entrance tile had to be waited on before

Special Thanks:
Ghast, for organising Make a Fun Chapter, whose second round Barhara Revisited was originally submitted for

Known Issues:
Lachesis has too many weapon ranks and they clip into her supports
Ballistas have glitchy palettes and disappear during map animations

I have verified that it is possible to complete the chapter on normal mode without anybody dying. I do not expect the player to do this, however. It's the Battle of Barhara. There will be casualties. The main aim is to prevent Sigurd from becoming one of them.

Good luck!
