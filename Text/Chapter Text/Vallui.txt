## ValluiWorldMap
Sigurd of Chalphy[Event] had noticed the latest[N]
fad in Jugdral: playing cards.[AN]
This wasn't the first time Jugdral was[N]
bitten by the trading card bug.[AN]
Indeed, everyone of prominence had already[N]
had a card printed of them the first time.[AN]
But now everyone is playing Fire Emblem[N]
Cipher, the second coming of the cards.[AN]
Hearing of its cancellation, Sigurd knew[N]
he had to set out on a journey, and fast.[AN]
Leaving Chalphy in Oifaye's reliable hands,[N]
Sigurd assembled a list of powerful cards[N]
and embarked on a journey to become the[AN]
world's best Cipher player, along with the[N]
various people his cards depicted.[AN]
[Event]
Little did Sigurd know that he would soon[N]
fight the greatest terror of all Cipher...[A][X]

## ValluiIntro
[Right][LoadSigurd][Left][LoadCelice]
#CELICE:
Father, I bring you bad news.[N]
We have been challenged to[AN]
a battle by the notorious Queen[N]
Corrin of Valla.[AN]
[Right]#SIGURD:
So, she has noticed us at last.[N]
I am not a coward. I will not[AN]
run away. With Tyrfing in hand,[N]
I shall cut Vallui down.[AN]
[Left]#CELICE:
A solid strategy. But the Tyrfing[N]
won't get through her defences.[AN]
She'll just copy Anankos and become[N]
invincible. Unless you want to[AN]
waste all your energy on one swing.[N]
Father, I do not recommend that.[AN]
[Right]#SIGURD:
I've got another plan, though.[N]
Deirdre! We have dragons to slay.[AN]
[FarRight][LoadDeirdre]
#DEIRDRE:
Though Corrin is a dragon, a lot of[N]
her cards aren't dragon-dragons.[AN]
In other words, I can't melt them.[N]
It would be too easy otherwise.[AN]
[Right]#SIGURD:
You can still deal with the other forms[N]
of the beast. I suppose I should reply[AN]
to Corrin's challenge. I only hope that[N]
I don't end up bricking my hand...[A][X]

## ValluiIntro2
[MR][LoadSigurd][ML][LoadCorrin]
#CORRIN:
Greetings, Lord Sigurd of Chalphy.[N]
I challenge you to a battle.[AN]
[MR]#SIGURD:
Queen Corrin of Valla, I accept your[N]
challenge. Let us select our decks.[AN]
[ML]#CORRIN:
Decks? No, no. We aren't playing cards.[N]
We're on the plains of Rigel. Where[AN]
Camus fought Jerome and joined Alm's army.[N]
And where I will destroy you and your[AN]
own army. You might think you can kill me.[N]
But I will stall you out. You will die.[AN]
[MR]#SIGURD:
I think not. Narga's divine light[N]
will purge you from this world.[AN]
[ML]#CORRIN:
Brynhildr shall snuff the[N]
life out of all your magic.[AN]
[MR]#SIGURD:
The Tyrfing will pierce your scales[N]
and protect me from your blade.[AN]
[ML]#CORRIN:
I shall copy Anankos, who will make[N]
me utterly indestructible.[AN]
[MR]#SIGURD:
My nephew, Leaf, will bring a United[N]
Thracia's might to bear on you.[AN]
[ML]#CORRIN:
Lilith shall shut down any and all[N]
summoning he plans to conduct.[AN]
[MR]#SIGURD:
My sister, Ethlin, will protect me from[N]
any destruction you plan to inflict.[AN]
[ML]#CORRIN:
Silas shall kill her first. Then, he[N]
will rearrange my defences.[AN]
[MR]#SIGURD:
Falaflame's power will be turned onto[N]
your field, destroying all in its way.[AN]
[ML]#CORRIN:
Azura shall banish this power, never[N]
to see the light of day again.[AN]
[MR]#SIGURD:
...At least I can have Lana heal my[N]
wounds, granting me staying power?[AN]
[ML]#CORRIN:
Elise can do the same to me. Also, the[N]
egg cuts your healing source off.[AN]
[MR]#SIGURD:
...What am I going to do? You counter[N]
all of my moves! With an egg?![AN]
[ML]#CORRIN:
I shall grant you a slight mercy: you[N]
have initiative. How shall you fare?[A][X]

## ValluiT2
[MR][LoadSigurd]
...Where's the Tyrfing? Without it,[N]
I am fodder for Vallui's army.[AN]
I need to find it fast, before she[N]
builds up... Otherwise, it's over.[AN][X]

## ValluiT3
[MR][LoadSigurd]
Still don't have my promotion...[N]
No Tyrfing, no hope. Simple.[AN]
...But perhaps with this move,[N]
I can remedy this situation.[AN]
[ML][LoadLana]
Need me to look for the Tyrfing?[N]
Celice probably borrowed it...[A][X]

## ValluiT3EP
[MR][LoadCorrin]
Silas! Go forth and[N]
run them down.[A][X]

## ValluiT4
[Left][LoadLana]
[MR][LoadSigurd]
[Left]#LANA:
Lord Sigurd! I found the Tyrfing![N]
Here you go! Now you can fight![AN]
[MR]#SIGURD:
Ah, yes... I need this blade to stand[N]
a chance. Thank you, Lana. Deirdre![AN]
[FL][LoadDeirdre]
It is time. Let us speed up this fight.[N]
Corrin's power is about to surge.[AN][X]

## ValluiT4EP
[MR][LoadCorrin][ML][LoadAzura]
[MR]#CORRIN:
It begins. Now it is time to assume my[N]
true form. I shall copy everybody's[AN]
abilities, and I shall become all but[N]
unstoppable. Azura, are we on track?[AN]
[ML]#AZURA:
We are indeed, Corrin. Ryoma is ready[N]
to take to the field and summon your[AN]
male counterpart. Beware of Leaf and[N]
his Unifier: Lilith isn't here...[A][X]

## ValluiT5
[Left][LoadLeaf][MR][LoadSigurd]
[Left]#LEAF:
Looks like I've made it. I don't have[N]
the strength to use my big finisher.[AN]
I can, however, use my smaller summon.[N]
Julia! Get in here! It's your turn![AN]
[FL][LoadJulia]
Lord Sigurd... We've got a lot of[N]
people on the battlefield. Beware[AN]
of destruction... We're in trouble[N]
if an enemy Leo destroys the mages.[AN][X]

## ValluiT5EP
[MR][LoadCorrin][Left][LoadCorrinM][FL][LoadRyoma]
[MR]#CORRIN:
Ryoma, go. Bring male Corrin with you.[N]
It is time to stall this battle out.[A][X]

## ValluiT6
[MR][LoadSigurd][ML][LoadEthlin]
[MR]#SIGURD:
Ethlin, I'd like to have your son[N]
do the big unification thing he[AN]
always boasts about, but I don't[N]
have the resources necessary.[AN]
More importantly, I need you to[N]
stop any destruction effects.[A]
[ML]#ETHLIN:
Of course, Sigurd. Also, I fear the[N]
arrival of an evil Earth Dragon...[AN]
Or whatever they call it in that[N]
land. "First Dragon"? ...Anankos.[A][X]

## ValluiT6EP
[MR][LoadCorrin][ML][LoadAzura]
[MR]#CORRIN:
Azura! Banishment to the Boundless[N]
Area is not destruction. As well,[AN]
I have finally obtained two things.[N]
I trust you are familiar with them.[AN]
[ML]
Very. Lilith shall shut down any[N]
deployment. And Anankos shall stall[AN]
any and all efforts to slay you.[N]
Victory is only a matter of time.[A][X]

## ValluiT7
[Left][LoadCelice][MR][LoadSigurd]
[Left]#CELICE:
Father, Lilith is blocking the big[N]
finishing Unifier. Are things bad[AN]
enough to require my deployment?[N]
With Anankos here, we can't finish[AN]
Corrin off. Alvis and Julius need[N]
to be summoned. The whole family...[AN]
[FL][LoadLinoan][MR]#SIGURD:
Lady Linoan, it appears we are going[N]
to be here for quite some time.[AN]
Keep the army's morale up: your job[N]
here is vital to our success.[AN]
[FL]#LINOAN:
I understand, Lord Sigurd.[N]
May victory come our way![A][X]

## ValluiT7EP
[MR][LoadCorrin][ML][LoadLeo]
[MR]#CORRIN:
Leo, deal with that Ethlin. Pink[N]
hair, on a horse. Then it is a[AN]
simple matter of annihilation.[N]
Now, I don't think I should worry[AN]
about bonds in the future...[N]
I shall deploy everyone left soon![A][X]

## ValluiT8
[MR][LoadSigurd]
The Book of Narga... I must give[N]
this to Deirdre or Julia! Its raw[AN]
might should destroy any annoying[N]
dragons blocking the way.[A][X]

## ValluiT8EP
[ML][LoadCorrin]
Enough waiting. Everyone, get out![N]
Destroy the Jugdral army, NOW![A][X]

## ValluiLeoKill
[ML][LoadLeo]
The path is clear. Their mages shall[N]
be utterly cleansed. DARK SILENCE![A][X]

## ValluiWeUnify
[MR][LoadLeaf]
Took that dragon down. Her blocking[N]
effect will soon fade. The Manster[AN]
District in the north. The Kingdom of[N]
Thracia in the south. Both are one.[AN]
Under the authority of I, King Leaf...[N]
I am... the UNIFIER OF THRACIA!![A][X]

## ValluiEnding
[ML][LoadCelice][MR][LoadSigurd]
...We did it. Vallui is dead.[N]
Just how did we do it?[AN]
[ML]
I have no idea, father. I have[N]
no idea. Dealing with her was[AN]
a complete nightmare. I fear the[N]
recovery costs are going to be[AN]
steep. How much do we owe Father[N]
Claude? It's not sustainable...[AN]
[MR]
We owe the bishop a lot. Let's[N]
see what's inside this fort...[AN][X]

## ValluiEnding2
[ML][LoadCelice][MR][LoadSigurd]
...It's... a card hoard! We can[N]
pay off Claude with all these[AN]
Super Rare Plus Corrins! If he[N]
won't take them, someone else[AN]
will. I'll take this card of me[N]
for myself. Can't have enough.[AN]
[ML]
And the same goes for me. The Final[N]
Holy War needs to be unleashed...[AN]
And perhaps I'll slip Lana some of[N]
these real expensive cards. Dad, do[AN]
you think she'd like a Super Rare[N]
Plus Peony? How about a Lilina?[AN]
[MR]
That's for you to figure out. I'll[N]
give your mother... herself.[AN]
Leaf and Nanna will like these...[N]
I'll let Alvis handle Julia...[AN]
Shanan would certainly appreciate[N]
this set... Our problems? Gone![AN]
[ML]
Dad, there's just one problem. We[N]
are currently in Rigel. That's a[AN]
few thousand miles away from Chalphy.[N]
There's not that many of us, and[AN]
there is no shortage of cards to[N]
carry back. What if we're attacked?[AN]
[MR]
If we can beat Vallui, we can beat[N]
anyone. Son, let's head home.[A][X]

## ValluiEnding3
Congratulations! You have defeated[N]
Vallui and proven Sigurd better.[N]
I always release a thing today,[N]
and I've been on a Cipher kick.[AN]
So I took my current Sigurd deck,[N]
took a generic Corrin deck, best[N]
in the game, and threw them on an[N]
FE2 map to save me some time.[AN]
I'd have liked to clean this up a[N]
bit more, and I might in time.[N]
Either way, I'll see you all again[N]
for my next project. - Darr[A][X]
