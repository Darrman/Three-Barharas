Welcome to the Barhara Collection.[N]
In this hack, the initial focus[AN]
was on my "Barhara Trilogy", three chapters[N]
whose maps were all identical: Chapter 5[AN]
of Genealogy of the Holy War's final stretch.[N]
Barhara Castle and its vicinity...[AN]
Other chapters held outside of Barhara,[N]
yet within Jugdral's bounds, may also be[AN]
added in addition to the core trilogy.[N]
You will be deposited on a platform.[AN]
Talk to any of the NPCs around in order to[N]
access one of the chapters. You will return[AN]
here once the chapter is complete.[N]
Every scenario has lengthy introduction text.[AN]
The ultimate aim of them is to defy the[N]
lord's destiny and claim victory...[AN]
Now, I will give a brief recap of the truth[N]
of the matter, as a background to it all.[AN]
Feel free to skip past if you know it already.[N]
And now, the Jugdral Chronology...[AN]
In the 5th century Gran Calendar, Bishop[N]
Galle the First created the Lopto Empire.[AN]
Two hundred years later, the Twelve Crusaders[N]
killed Galle XVII and destroyed the Empire.[AN]
Jugdral was divided into several kingdoms.[N]
In the 750s, it returned on the path to war.[AN]
Most notably, Sigurd of Chalphy's campaign[N]
begun in the year 757, continuing until 760.[AN]
Then, he was executed by Alvis of Velthomer.[N]
He then promptly consolidated rule of the[AN]
Grandbell Empire. About a decade later,[N]
his son Julius resurrected the Lopto Empire.[AN]
Come 777 Celice, Sigurd's son, rose up in[N]
revolt to depose Julius, avenge Sigurd,[AN]
and eventually seizing the throne himself.[N]
Peace was finally restored to Jugdral.[AN]
However, twenty years of war ravaged the land.[N]
Can Celice truly break the cycle of war?[AN][X]

[Red]Barhara Revisited[Red][AN]
At long last, Sigurd of Chalphy has reached[N]
the doors of Barhara Castle. The bodies of[N]
Dukes Reptor and Langbart lie in the sands of[N]
Yied. Lord Alvis appears to be sympathetic...[AN]
But this is all a trap. Sigurd's search for[N]
Deirdre, his missing wife, has concluded:[N]
now she appears to be wed to Alvis.[N]
A sinister conspiracy is unfolding.[AN]
Sigurd is up for execution: destiny says[N]
Barhara is his doom, as it is for his army.[N]
And the truth about Deirdre and Alvis will[N]
only bring Jugdral to ruin.[AN]
Guide Sigurd to safety! Rescue Deirdre![N]
Defy destiny, and cross back through its[N]
doors! Return to Barhara, and set history[N]
right! Onwards, to victory![AN][X]

## JuliusRevengeSelected
[Red]Julius's Revenge[Red][AN]
Seventeen years have passed since the Battle[N]
of Barhara. The ambitions of Alvis of Velthomer[N]
were crushed, and Sigurd of Chalphy now[N]
rules over Grandbell. Yet, all is not right.[AN]
Princess Julia is in truth the daughter of[N]
Alvis, and she has a twin brother hidden from[N]
the world... Julius. The scorned and forgotten[N]
heir to Loputousu's power.[AN]
Abandoned by Sigurd for fear of the Lopto[N]
Empire returning, he eventually found his[N]
way to Yied Shrine, holy to the Loptians.[N]
There, he planned his revenge.[AN]
He would take his minions to Barhara,[N]
and from there, massacre the ruling class[N]
and restore Galle's ancient empire...[AN]
Sweep away the Crusaders. Bring Jugdral under[N]
shadow once more. Ensure the line of Narga[N]
can no longer threaten the line of Lopt...[A][X]

Well, it kind of needs to be finished first.[N]
For now, enjoy my One Hour Blitz entry.[A][X]
