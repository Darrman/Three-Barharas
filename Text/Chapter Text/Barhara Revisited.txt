Sigurd of Chalphy, I hearby[N]
sentence you to death for your[AN]
crimes of treason. His Majesty[N]
will not be seeing you,[AN]
today or ever.[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadSigurd]
W-what?! What are you
talking about, Lord Alvis?![A]
[OpenLeft]
Heh... You are only realising now?[N]
You are far too naive, Sigurd.[AN]
Need I remind you that you and[N]
your father still sought to[A]
usurp the throne and plotted[N]
against the crown?[AN]
Nothing has changed. It is my[N]
duty to exact justice upon you,[AN]
in the name of my wife,[N]
Princess [....]Deirdre. [AN]
I trust you understand, Sigurd.[AN]
[OpenRight]
P-Princess Deirdre?! That...[N]
No, it can't be...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Ah, of course. You've  never met,[N]
correct? Very well. I suppose[AN]
an introduction would be[N]
a fair parting gift before your[AN]
demise. Come, Deirdre![N]
Greet our guests![A][X]

[OpenLeft][LoadAlvis]
Deirdre, allow me to intro-[N]
duce you to Sigurd: the spawn[AN]
of your father's murderer, Byron.
I trust you have some...[AN]
choice words for him?[AN]
[MoveFarLeft]
[OpenLeft][LoadSigurd]
[OpenRight]
So... So this is...[N]
Sir Sigurd?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Deirdre?! No...[N]
This can't be happening... [AN]
[OpenRight]
Why... Why are you[N]
speaking like this?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Deirdre! It really is[N]
you! No... No, no, no...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Do... Do you know me, sir?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
OF COURSE I DO![N]
YOU'RE MY W-[N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Enough! Deirdre, stand[N]
clear. This is an extremely[AN]
dangerous man. Rest assured:[N]
this traitor will be punished.[AN]
[OpenRight]
But... He... He's... [....] Can't we have[N]
even a little more time?[N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Unacceptable. Guards![N]
Escort the princess to the[AN]

Wait! Alvis, please![N]

W-wait! DEIRDRE! Alvis,
please! I beg of you![N]
She... She's my...-[N]
[OpenRight]
Enough! I grow weary of[N]
your ravings. Attention, men![AN]
We no longer have any use for[N]
keeping the traitors alive.[AN]
Move in on Sigurd and his[N]
party! The time to serve them [AN]
their punishment has come![AN]

NO! I MISSED! WHAT WAS THAT[N]
VOICE?! AND WHY IS THERE NO[AN]
MORE FIRE?! WHO IN ALL JUDGRAL[N]
WOULD DO SUCH INSANITY!? DID SHE-[AN]
[OpenLeft]I'm... still alive...?[N]
Did... Alvis... miss?[AN]
[OpenRight]... I cast the Falaflame[N]
wrong somehow! And I think[AN]
I attacked a fake Sigurd![N]
How could this be?![AN]
[OpenLeft] YOU DASTARD... YOU'LL PAY![N]
Men, prepare for battle![AN]
Let's prove to Alvis that we[N]
won't be going down so easy![A][X]

## BurnedLevinsScarf

[OpenRight][LoadLevin]
Heh, that Alvis fool attacked[N]
my scarf! Thought it was[AN]
your head. Ha! I can dodge[N]
everything he throws at me![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well that explains the miss.[N]
Nothing can ever hit you...[AN]
[OpenRight]Now then, I'm in a mood[N]
for slaying major holy blood[AN]
people right now. Time to send[N]
Alvis down to Reptor's place:[AN]
down and out, into the grave.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Wait, why is your head not on[N]
fire at all? [AN]
Falaflame is hot, miss or no![AN]
[OpenRight]I think someone threw[N]
some water on me or something.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah... Anyway.[AN]
Men, draw your weapons.[N]
Let's get outta here, before [AN]
Alvis smartens up! My fortunes say[N]
I'm to die. I think I'll be[AN]
averting that particular tale.[AN]
And Deirdre... Just hold on.[N]
Sigurd's coming for you, love...[A][X]

## BringAzmureSigurd

[OpenLeft][LoadAzmure]
Ahh... So you are with[N]
Sir Sigurd's army, correct?[AN]
I'm not sure what's happening...[N]
Lord Alvis claims that Sigurd is trying[AN]
to usurp me and that Lord Byron has[N]
slain my son on the battlefield...[AN]
Soldier, bring Sir Sigurd in here,[N]
so he can explain everything.[AN][X]

Please... Just...[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadDeirdre]
Ahh... I... feel... like...[N]

Were you...[N]
[OpenLeft]*sniff* Ahh... Please![N]
Remember! Ahh, I finally found you...[AN]
YOU'RE MY WIFE!![N]
[OpenRight]...Ahh. I... remember now.[N]
You... are my husbamd. Sigurd...[AN]
[OpenLeft] You remember... *sniff*[N]
I love you... so so much...[AN]
[OpenRight]I love you too...[N]
...but Sigurd...[AN]
[OpenLeft]Yes?[AN]
[OpenRight]Well... I'm sure you've noticed...[AN]
[OpenLeft]...Yeah. You're expecting...[N]
What are we going to do with them? [AN]
[OpenRight]... I don't know. The Loptos are[N]
praising the baby as the next coming[AN]
of the Dark Lord, but they're also afraid[N]
of the Narga line continuing... [AN]
[OpenLeft]Twins, perhaps? I suppose there's[N]
only one way to find out...[AN]
...Please don't have Major Lopt-[N]
Lopotoe- please don't be evil.[AN]
[OpenRight]I hope so too...[N]
I hope so too.[AN][X]

## MedievalPhotography
[OpenRight][LoadSigurd]
[OpenLeft][LoadAzmure]
Sir Sigurd, please explain[N]
everything. What is happening?[AN]
[OpenRight]
Well, it's been a long time[N]
since this all started. As you[AN]
know, Prince Kurth was assassinated[N]
in the war with Isaac, and my father[AN]
was blamed for the whole affair.[N]
However, I have since found out[AN]
that it was actually Lord Langbart[N]
who killed Prince Kurth![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Really? Is this true?[AN]
[OpenRight]
Yes, it is true. Your Majesty,[N]
please read this. This should[AN]
prove my innocence to you. Lord[N]
Reptor was hiding it from you...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Yes... "...wasn't there... in Silesia...[N]
...innocent... nothing to do with it...[AN]
Reptor and Langbart did everything...[N]
...Please clear Sigurd of all charges."[AN]
...I see. I do believe you are innocent,[N]
but Lord Alvis may not. Be careful...[AN]
...Before you go, there seems to be an[N]
evil force around... Here, take this.[AN]
[OpenRight]
This is... The Book of Narga?[N]
Who can use this? You're... you know,[AN]
the prince is long dead, and...[N]
well, you've heard about my wife.[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Doesn't she have the same name as the[N]
royal princess? Deirdre, I believe.[AN]
[OpenRight]
...She IS the royal princess. Take a[N]
look at this strange "photo" thing I[AN]
bought in Agustria. It has a picture on[N]
it, and I'm sure you can see... [AN]
[OpenLeft]
So you're saying she was abducted by dark[N]
priests, had her mind wiped, and then Lord[AN]
Alvis found her without her memories? So[N]
he shouldn't have been allowed to marry her?[AN]
[OpenRight]
No, he shouldn't. She's... *sniff*[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Quick, take the Book of Narga. I see dark[N]
men around often. They seem to always wish[AN]
of its destruction. Take it, and go! Alvis[N]
has called for reinforcements to the south.[AN]
Now give the book to your wife. She can[N]
surely use it. Beware of Alvis...[AN]
Beware of the Lopt Sect.[AN][X]

swimmingly. The girl is now[N]

[OpenRight]Yes, she is. Don't worry,[N]

[OpenFarFarLeft][N]
YAY! I love you, Mammy![N]
[OpenLeft][N]
Aw... Anyway, milord, how did the[N]
battle in Barhara fare? Did we-[N][X]

## YiedRecap
[OpenRight]
It was... brutal.[N]
After you fled with Celice, my[N]
army charged through Yied.[N]
Velthomer soldiers were raining[N]
meteors constantly at us.[N]
When we seized the castle, I found[N]
out that Cuan and Ethlin[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
were slain in an ambush by some[N]
Thracian dracoknights. That news[N]
made me snap. Nothing would stand in[N]
my way. So, we marched onwards.[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Onwards... to Barhara Castle.[N][X]

## BarharaRecap
[OpenRight][N]
We eventually reached Velthomer[N]
and was greeted to a royal welcome...[N]
One that quickly turned sour.[N]
Alvis barely gave us a moment's rest[N]
before declaring us traitors.[N]
But the grounds of Barhara[N]
also were where I found Deirdre:[N]
standing at Alvis's side.[N]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
Hm?[N]
[OpenRight]
Nothing![N]
...Anyway, Alvis just taunted[N]
me, claiming she was his now.[N]
I was at tears at this stage...[N]
And he just went on his rant.[N]
Eventually, Alvis stopped talking[N]
and started to cast Falaflame.[N]
[OpenLeft]
...! You...[N]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]... ...[ToggleMouthMove] I thought I was done for.[N]
However, something distracted[N]
Alvis, and the attack missed.[N]
Once the smoke cleared, the[N]
meteors begun. Huge rocks[N]
of flame flew out of the[N]
sky, and the screaming...[N]
...None of them targeted me,[N]
but we had no time to waste.[N]
We took flight to the north,[N]
but I had personal business.[N]
Alvis stole my wife.[ToggleSmile][N]
And as you can see,[N]
that wrong was righted.[N]
Those Lopt... you knows,[N]
had wiped her memory, but[N]
by some miracle, she still[N]
remembered me.[N]
Alvis was furious, but[N]
his time was up.[N]
We had a duel, for the world's[N]
sake, but when he fell...[N]
I don't think he perished.[N]
Dark forces were at play.[N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Dark forces? Like that weird[N]
man that kidnapped Deirdre?[N][X]

## ManfloyRecap
[OpenFarLeft][LoadYoungShanan][OpenRight][LoadSigurd][OpenLeft][LoadYoungOifaye]
[OpenRight]
...I found that man.[N]
While we fled from Barhara,[N]
a horrible bishop stood at[N]
Velthomer. He introduced himself[N]
as Manfloy, and he was the one.[N]
He had a staff in his hands[N]
that can mind control people, and[N]
I dare say that was the same magic[N]
used to wipe Deirdre's memory.[N]
That monster was the man[N]
leading the Lopt Sect...[N]
I saw to it that he would not[N]
live another day. Manfloy[N]
has ruined many, many lives.[N]
He was the man who caused this[N]
whole mess. Everyone on the continent[N]
seemed to have some part in his[N]
disgusting schemes... I found out[N]
that everything he did was[N]
to revive the Dark Lord of[N]
legend. The worst part is that[N]
the child of Deirdre and[N]
Alvis... was to be the host[N]
of the Dark Lord.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That was it. The Lopt[N]
Sect must be destroyed. But we didn't[N]
have time to rout them. My remaining[N]
men regrouped at Velthomer, and[N]
should be waiting in Silesia.[N]
From there, we return to Chalphy.[ToggleSmile][N]

That reminds me of Manfloy's plans...[N]

...Send the boy away. The Lopt Sect[N]
might return... and we'll just...[N]
...Give him to one of your knights[N]
or something. Keep them company...[N]

I suppose. I don't want the public[N]
wondering why he has red hair...[N]
...Let's keep the girl, though. She[N]
looks just like you, right down to[N]
that mark of Narga.[N]
[OpenLeft]
...Yes. ...What should we name her?[N]
I like the sound of... Julia.[N]
