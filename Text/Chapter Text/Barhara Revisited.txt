death for your acts of[AN]
treason. No visits to the[N]

Wh-what? Lord Alvis, what is[N]
the meaning of this?![AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh heh... You're just now catching[N]
on? I'm afraid you're far too late,[AN]
my friend. You and your father plotted[N]
to usurp the throne. That hasn't[AN]
changed. As the husband of Princess[N]

personal, Sigurd.[A]

W-what?! What are you[N]

Heh... You are only realising now?[N]
You are far too naive, Sigurd.[AN]
Need I remind you that you and[N]

usurp the throne and plotted[N]

Nothing has changed. It is my[N]

Ah, of course. You've never met,[N]

## ExtraGoalClarification
[Left][LoadNoish][MR][LoadSigurd]

Sire, our current situation[N]
is untenable. We must flee.[AN]
We are surrounded on all sides[N]
by Alvis and his men. I believe[AN]
we must make our escape towards[N]
Velthomer Castle, [Red]northeast[Red][AN]
of our current location. There[N]
will be casualties. Outside of[AN]
Alvis's forces, I suspect there[N]
are more sinister elements at play.[AN]
[FL][LoadAlec]
Whoa there, buddy. You mean to[N]
suggest we just run on outta here[AN]
without saving Mrs. Chalphy? The[N]
boss's been looking for her for[AN]
how long now? Sigurd, someone's[N]
gotta make it their job to visit[AN]
the king! You've got a name to[N]
clear, after all. Queen Rahna's[AN]
been trying, but Reptor kept that[N]
quiet. Cut out the middleman and[AN]
visit the king directly! Do make it[N]
quick, though. Noish has a point;[AN]
we can't be sticking around forever.[N]
Save Deirdre, see the king, run![A]
[MR]
Hmm... You both have points... But[N]
I can't leave Deirdre behind. I must[AN]
talk to her... And then, she might[N]
remember everything once more...[AN][X]

[OpenLeft][LoadAzmure]
Sir Sigurd, please explain[N]
everything. What is happening?[AN]
[OpenRight]
Well, it's been a long time[N]
since this all started. As you[AN]
know, Prince Kurth was assassinated[N]
in the war with Isaac, and my father[AN]
was blamed for the whole affair.[N]
However, I have since found out[AN]
that it was actually Lord Langbart[N]
who killed Prince Kurth![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Really? Is this true?[AN]
[OpenRight]
Yes, it is true. Your Majesty,[N]
please read this. This should[AN]
prove my innocence to you. Lord[N]
Reptor was hiding it from you...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Yes... "...wasn't there... in Silesia...[N]
...innocent... nothing to do with it...[AN]
Reptor and Langbart did everything...[N]
...Please clear Sigurd of all charges."[AN]
...I see. I do believe you are innocent,[N]
but Lord Alvis may not. Be careful...[AN]
...Before you go, there seems to be an[N]
evil force around... Here, take this.[AN]
[OpenRight]
This is... The Book of Narga?[N]
Who can use this? You're... you know,[AN]
the prince is long dead, and...[N]
well, you've heard about my wife.[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Doesn't she have the same name as the[N]
royal princess? Deirdre, I believe.[AN]
[OpenRight]
...She IS the royal princess. Take a[N]
look at this strange "photo" thing I[AN]
bought in Agustria. It has a picture on[N]
it, and I'm sure you can see...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
So you're saying she was abducted by[N]
dark priests, had her mind wiped,[AN]
and then Lord Alvis found her without[N]
her memories? So he shouldn't have[AN]
been allowed to marry her?[AN]
[OpenRight]
No, he shouldn't. She's... *sniff*[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Quick, take the Book of Narga. I see[N]
dark men around often. They seem to[AN]
always wish of its destruction. Take[N]
it, and go! Alvis has called for[AN]
reinforcements to the south.[N]
Now give the book to your wife. She can[AN]
surely use it. Beware of Alvis...[N]
Beware of the Lopt Sect.[AN][X]

[OpenFarRight][MoveFarFarLeft][N]
[OpenFarFarLeft][N]
YAY! I love you, Mammy![AN]
[OpenLeft][N]
Aw... Anyway, milord, how did the[N]
battle in Barhara fare? Did we-[AN]

[Right][MoveMidRight]
It was... brutal.[AN]
After you fled with Celice, my[N]
army charged through Yied.[AN]
Velthomer soldiers were raining[N]
meteors constantly at us.[AN]
When we seized the castle, I found[N]
out that Cuan and Ethlin[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
were slain in an ambush by some[N]
Thracian dracoknights. That news[AN]
made me snap. Nothing would stand in[N]
my way. So, we marched onwards.[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
Onwards... to Barhara Castle.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
We eventually reached Velthomer[N]
and was greeted to a royal welcome...[AN]
One that quickly turned sour.[N]
Alvis barely gave us a moment's rest[AN]
before declaring us traitors.[N]
But the grounds of Barhara[AN]
also were where I found Deirdre:[N]
standing at Alvis's side.[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
Hm?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Nothing![AN]
...Anyway, Alvis just taunted[N]
me, claiming she was his now.[AN]
I was at tears at this stage...[N]
And he just went on his rant.[AN]
Eventually, Alvis stopped talking[N]
and started to cast Falaflame.[AN]
[OpenLeft]
...! You...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]... ...[ToggleMouthMove] I thought I was done for.[N]
However, something distracted[AN]
Alvis, and the attack missed.[N]
Once the smoke cleared, the[AN]
meteors begun. Huge rocks[N]
of flame flew out of the[AN]
sky, and the screaming...[N]
...None of them targeted me,[AN]
but we had no time to waste.[N]
We took flight to the north,[AN]
but I had personal business.[N]
Alvis stole my wife.[ToggleSmile][AN]
And as you can see,[N]
that wrong was righted.[AN]
Those Lopt... you knows,[N]
had wiped her memory, but[AN]
by some miracle, she still[N]
remembered me.[AN]
Alvis was furious, but[N]
his time was up.[AN]
We had a duel, for the world's[N]
sake, but when he fell...[AN]
I don't think he perished.[N]
Dark forces were at play.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Dark forces? Like that weird[N]
man that kidnapped Deirdre?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
...I found that man.[N]
While we fled from Barhara,[AN]
a horrible bishop stood at[N]
Velthomer. He introduced himself[AN]
as Manfloy, and he was the one.[N]
He had a staff in his hands[AN]
that can mind control people, and[N]
I dare say that was the same magic[AN]
used to wipe Deirdre's memory.[N]
That monster was the man[AN]
leading the Lopt Sect...[N]
I saw to it that he would not[AN]
live another day. Manfloy[N]
has ruined many, many lives.[AN]
He was the man who caused this[N]
whole mess. Everyone on the continent[AN]
seemed to have some part in his[N]
disgusting schemes... I found out[AN]
that everything he did was[N]
to revive the Dark Lord of[AN]
legend. The worst part is that[N]
the child of Deirdre and[AN]
Alvis... was to be the host[N]
of the Dark Lord.[AN]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That was it. The Lopt[N]
Sect must be destroyed. But we didn't[AN]
have time to rout them. My remaining[N]
men regrouped at Velthomer, and[AN]
should be waiting in Silesia.[N]
From there, we return to Chalphy.[ToggleSmile][AN]
