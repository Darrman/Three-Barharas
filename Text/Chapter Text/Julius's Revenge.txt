## RagefestWorldMap
The continent of Jugdral. It's a land[N]
with a long history, and most of it[AN]
a violent one. In the year 760, a[N]
great battle took place, known as the[AN]
Battle of Barhara. The forces of the[N]
duchies of Chalphy and Velthomer went[AN]
head to head, but eventually Lord Sigurd[N]
prevailed, and left the battle uncharred.[AN]
Soon after Sigurd and his wife, Deirdre,[N]
announced the birth of their daughter,[AN]
Julia, but not all was as it seemed.[N]
The truth was, she was actually the child[AN]
of Alvis, duke of Velthomer, who vanished[N]
after Barhara. She also had a twin brother...[AN]
Julius. Inheritor of the Dark Lord's[N]
power, and cast away from Grandbell.[AN]
Several years passed in peace, but[N]
Julius planned revenge in the shadows.[AN]
He met with the remmants of the Lopt[N]
Sect in Yied Shrine, and gathered some[AN]
soldiers known as the "Dark Warlords"[N]
from a conflict happening in Thracia.[AN]
The year is 777. The children of[N]
Sigurd's old army were at Barhara,[AN]
when suddenly, a new army took to the[N]
fold, lead by the forsaken prince, Julius.[AN][X]

Barhara's throne at last. Finally,[N]
I've ousted those stupid Heims.[AN]
Nobody was even guarding the castle![N]
The king wasn't home, the queen[AN]
also wasn't home, and the prince[N]
is just messing around at Velthomer.[AN]
If I can snuff out Celice's life,[N]
then the world is mine. Brother...[AN]
You will regret being born! And[N]
as for your father... you should have[AN]
died twenty years ago. Dark Warlords![N]
I've this funny feeling that this[AN]
battle was meant to happen. And[N]
I shall prevail! The Scion of Light[AN]
shall meet his end, and the Dark Lord[N]
will rise again, and the Lopto Empire[AN]
shall return! That accursed Narga...[N]
...will bother me no more! Let's go![AN][X]

## RagefestEnding
[MR][LoadVoid]
Ahahahaha... AHAHAHAHAHA!![N]
He's dead! That demented brother[AN]
of mine is finally dead! The[N]
Scion of Light is no more! The[AN]
remaining crusaders are nothing[N]
without him! Bishop Manfloy,[AN]
I thank you for your guidance.[N]
Without you, I'd be stuck with[AN]
that Grandbellian knight forever,[N]
and I'd never know all of my power.[AN]
The power of Loputousu... the[N]
Dark Lord. Now, it's revenge time.[AN]
Barhara is mine. The continent[N]
will fall in a matter of weeks![AN]
Farewell, Narga. Goodbye, Holsety.[N]
The world is mine... and I swear,[AN]
no Miracle of Darna will stop me!![AN]
