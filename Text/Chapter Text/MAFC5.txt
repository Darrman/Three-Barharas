## MAFC5MapNarration
The continent of Jugdral has seen better[N]
days. Its past glories are exactly that.[AN]
Now, the world revolves around the land of[N]
Zenith - or to be more specific,[AN]
the Kingdom of Askr. The mighty Order of[N]
Heroes, one of the most diverse militaries[AN]
to grace the planet, has imposed its will[N]
across all. And though direct Askran rule[AN]
may not yet be forced on Jugdral, it is[N]
firmly within its sphere of influence.[AN]
Regular elections to the Parliament of Heroes[N]
are held throughout Askr and beyond.[AN]
Sigurd Chalphy, head of the Jugdral Party,[N]
was once unquestionably the most powerful[AN]
figure on the continent. However, his faction[N]
proved unpopular in the corridors of power.[AN]
The Fodlan Party, headed by a certain[N]
Byleth Eisner, dominated the polls.[AN]
Jugdral's share of the vote plummeted.[N]
The General Election of 797 looms.[AN]
Will the electorate give the old Chalphy[N]
dynasty another run at power?[AN][X]

[MR][LoadSigurd]
Son, the situation is truly dire.[N]
The Fodlanese are co-opting our[AN]
primary issues in the eyes of Askr.[N]
And as a result, the polls look grim.[AN]
[ML]
That blasted Constituency Commission![N]
They just had to slash the Jugdral MPs[AN]
returned by a third! The population's[N]
perfectly stable. Gerrymanderers![AN]
[MR]
Indeed. Barely any of our candidates[N]
held their seats. Doesn't help when[AN]
their old seat suddenly has a huge[N]
pocket of Hoshidan support included.[AN]
Son, call in the nephew. Thracia's[N]
in utter freefall.[AN]
[ML]
Of course.[A]
#Event here, Leaf running in?
[ML][MoveLeft]
[FL][LoadLeaf]
Freefall? That's kind. If we don't claw[N]
something back soon, the Jugdral Party[AN]
in the Thracian Peninsula is finished.[N]
The only poll-topper we have is Reinhardt.[AN]
And I don't know if he's with us or if he's[N]
with the Order of Heroes directly...[AN]
[Left]
His Senate chances are shot, though.[N]
Another sweep for the Fodlan Party...[AN]
We need to strategise. I'd love another[N]
run at it, but the odds are poor.[AN]
[MR]
Son, we need to put someone forward.[N]
If we don't field any Senate candidates,[AN]
there isn't a hope we'll take House seats.[N]
You came close last year. Celice Chalphy,[AN]
Senator for Barhara. Nice ring around it.[N]
Then you propel me in next term.[AN]
[Left]
The odds of that happening now that I've[N]
been dubbed Legendary have plummeted.[AN]
Speaking of, you absolutely should be[N]
put forward to the Legends Commission.[AN]
[FL]
I agree. If my father was still around,[N]
he'd support your bid in a heartbeat.[AN]
Are we not the three Lords of Jugdral?[N]
Two of us are Legends. Now for the third.[AN]
[MR]
The Legends, the front bench of the coalition...[N]
Now's not the time to dream of ministries.[AN]

## MAFC5OpeningRunningCandidates
# CG: constituency maps?
[FL][LoadLeaf]
[Left][LoadCelice]
[Right][LoadSigurd]
[FL]
Grandbell's been cut down to one constituency[N]
per duchy. Each duchy has an amount[AN]
of MPs, and we need to make sure that[N]
those MPs belong to us.[AN]
Let's start here, in Barhara.[N]
Celice and Julia hold comfortable majorities.[AN]
There should be little issue defending it.[N]
Velthomer is safe for your old friend[AN]
Alvis. Cyas is clinging on by a slender[N]
margin. It might be wise to swap him[AN]
out for Azel instead and give him a run.[N]
Dozel is a problem. We hold no seats there.[AN]
Candidates can hail from wherever they please,[N]
and the main Dozel seat is held by a[AN]
certain Laslow of the Conquest Party.[N]
Lex Dozel is the obvious candidate here.[AN]
Freege is an interesting one. Honestly,[N]
I have no idea how Tiltyu is holding a seat.[AN]
Shore up her support and hold it at any cost.[N]
If you're feeling brazen, you could try[AN]
and push for another one. I am not feeling[N]
brazen.[AN]
[Left]
I'll take over for a bit, if you don't mind.[N]
Edda's a lost cause. I'm surprised Claude[N]
Riegan hasn't sailed in and took ten seats[AN]
this side of Thracia because he shares his[N]
name with the Archbishop.[AN]
Always with the Fodlan Party. Here's hoping[N]
Tinny doesn't get mad if she sees Hilda[AN]
Goneril on a Freege ballot.[N]
Either way, Chalphy. Your home constituency,[AN]
Sigurd. You're a certainty to top the poll.[N]
How about you bring in a running mate?[AN]
I owe a lot to Oifaye and he really should[N]
have been elected long ago. Bring him in![AN]
Jungby's not looking too good. Brigid is[N]
the MP for Orgahil, not Jungby.[AN]
I'd love to get dear Lana into the House,[N]
but realistically, she doesn't have a hope.[AN]
Campaign for Faval, I suppose, if you want[N]
any slim chance at taking a seat here.[AN]
[Right]
That's... not the greatest. Still, perhaps[N]
the safe seats will hold.[AN]

[ML][LoadSigurd][MR][LoadLeaf]
[ML]
The Parliament has a vendetta against the[N]
Peninsula. There has to be one.[AN]
They slash its representation at every turn.[N]
No development ever gets approved there.[AN]
And we take all the blame for Askran idleness.[N]
Leaf, how's your wing of the party holding?[AN]
[MR]
To be blunt, poorly. I've a respectable[N]
amount of votes in Lenster. No other[AN]
constituencies there anymore. Just Lenster.[N]
I'm not getting any expansion here.[AN]
Just keeping Nanna and Fin in office will[N]
be miraclous. Alster's home to a lot[AN]
of Freegian MPs for some reason. Reinhardt,[N]
being the big poll-topper. Olwen, part[AN]
of the dynasty. His nemesis Kempf gets[N]
voted in as a protest vote, too.[AN]
Manster? Conote? Nothing. Sety stands[N]
for Silesia, obviously. Nobody else has[AN]
a hope. There's no more Frest constituency.[N]
Asvel isn't getting any votes in Lenster![AN]
Tahra's been drawn inside Luthecia, south[N]
of the border. What were they thinking?[AN]
Making sure there's no Linoan seat, that's[N]
what. Don't get me started on the Purple[AN]
Dragon Mountain debacle. Or perhaps I should[N]
say Mease, because that's what it's been[AN]
lumped into. I swear, that stupid fairy,[N]
I don't care what her name is, rigged it.[AN]
Rigged the election, stole the seat, you[N]
name it. That's Dagda's seat. Not the fairy's.[A][X]

We should quickly tour Grandbell and[N]

Lord Sigurd! Welcome to Velthomer.[N]
We're attempting to consolidate[AN]
the old Velthomer dynasty, so I'm[N]
serving as Alvis's running mate.[AN]
My brother has served for some time,[N]
so he's confident he can get me in.[AN]
[Right]
Ah, Lord Alvis of Velthomer...[N]
It only makes sense for Azel[AN]
to run here too. We must work[N]
together for now. You have my[AN]
support in defending your seat[N]
and getting one for Azel as well.[AN]
[FL]
You have my thanks, Sigurd. Alvis[N]
Velthomer and Azel Velthomer.[AN]
Those are the names that shall be[N]
voted \#1 and \#2.[AN]
I hear Bishop Cyas is carving a bit[N]
of a name for himself in Thracia.[AN]
Not a word to the public, but since[N]
he is my son, I should help him...[AN]
[FR]
Not to worry. An anonymous donor will[N]
transfer everything needed. Be well,[AN]

Oh, hi there! I'm doing just fine,[N]

But to be fair, it's quite a narrow[N]
margin. I've got Tinny here trying[AN]
to take a seat in Parliament too,[N]
but I don't know if she's cut out[AN]
for the job. She's never been one[N]
to be particularly outgoing...[AN]

Hello, Lord Sigurd... Hello, Lord[N]

running mate in the election...[N]
I just want to do the people right.[AN]

We're really scraping the barrel,[N]
aren't we... Ahem. Tiltyu, how[AN]
is the situation looking? Freege is[N]
in a precarious situation.[AN]

Well my niece Ishtar's doing well enough[N]
for herself, but I don't really get[AN]
along with Blume's side of the family.[N]
I can't stand that Hilda. How is she[AN]
in any way related to Azel, anyway?[N]

Election campaigning, as you know.[N]
We currently lack any Dozel seats.[AN]
[Left]
And it's damned irritating, too.[N]
I get denied office by the slimmest[AN]
of margins. I swear, the Order has[N]
a vendetta against the axe knight.[AN]
So I'm gonna show the Parliament[N]
what's what by having two axe knights[AN]
on the ballot. Nephew Johan's not the[N]
brightest, but he'll do the job.[AN]
[FL]
There's nothing in this world more[N]
beautiful than my beloved Lakche![AN]
The public will vote for me in droves![N]
Such romance will prove irresistible![AN]
[FR]
Do I point out that they're cousins?[N]
I don't think the public would approve.[AN]
[Right]
They would not. Blood purity is of no[N]
concern. In fact, it may hamper the[AN]
health of the descendants of those[N]
within a relationship between those[AN]
closely related. Perhaps I should[N]
opt to campaign against such acts.[A]
[Left]
That's a dangerous promise to make.[N]
I've no qualm with anti-incest laws.[AN]
It's strictly forbidden, for obvious[N]
reasons, after all. But cousins[AN]
within the nobility wedding is still[N]
a fairly frequent occurance. If you[AN]
make taking a stand against incest,[N]
untold controversies - rebellions[AN]
in the party, even - may occur.[N]
Hypocrisy within the Party's upper[AN]
echelons will prove Jugdral's ruin.[N]
Need I remind you of the rumours[AN]
circluating around you, Celice?[N]
Could get you and papa in trouble...[AN][X]

My daughter has actually taken a seat in[N]

in exactly [Red]thirty days[Red].[AN]
Canvassing is of vital importance.[N]
Enter the castles and knock on doors.[N]
This will improve our standing amongst[N]

Of course, the media and our opponents[N]

They will attack our candidates at[N]
every turn. The press are not on our[N]

If a severe blow against a candidate[N]

them from candidacy to save the rest[N]
of the Party. Manage approval well.[AN]
For Jugdral! The Jugdral Party's aim[N]

Sigurd Chalphy: The Greatest Warmonger[N]
in the 8th Century G.C.[AN]
Lord Chalphy has many titles. Duke of[N]
Chalphy. King of Grandbell. Indeed,[N]
there was a time he could have pushed[AN]
to become Emperor of Jugdral. And he[N]
went about this by burning Jugdral to[N]
ashes. Agustria remembers well the[AN]
devestation wrought upon it by Chalphy's[N]
army. The old nobility was decimated.[N]
Two decades of instability? Chalphy.[AN]
Take Verdane. A better statesman would[N]
have negotiated with King Batou during[N]
the Aideen Jungby abduction scandal.[AN]
But he did not wait. He instantly[N]
waged war without any thought for the[N]
consequences. And those consequences?[AN]
Verdane is still utterly deprived after[N]
that brutal, savage war. Their king is[N]
the son of a shameless collaborator[AN]
that joined the Chalphy army, though[N]
he is still of the royal line. This was[N]
entirely Chalphy's fault.[AN]
(See Page 10 for our analysis on Jamka[N]
Verdane and his role in Verdane's state.)[A][X]

[Red]-- THE ASKR TELEGRAPH --[Red][N]
Alvis Velthomer: Secret Links to the[N]
Evil Sect of Loputousu[AN]
When one thinks of the Duke of Velthomer,[N]
they tend to think of a stern, imposing[N]
man. A man with high ideals, but with[AN]
few scruples when it comes to what he[N]
believes to be the "greater good".[N]
According to a man known as Galle XVIII,[AN]
Velthomer has gone to extreme lengths[N]
to bring about his ideal world. Our[N]
source claims this to have started during[AN]
the instability of the 750s. Working[N]
in collaboration with a figure known as[N]
"Archbishop Manfloy", the pair orchestrated[AN]
a cunning scheme to resurrect the evil[N]
Earth Dragon Loputousu, along with other[N]
members of the Lopt Sect. During his[AN]
tenure as King of Grandbell, he had wed[N]
now-Queen Deirdre Heim. Interviews with[N]
King Shanan Isaac confirm Manfloy's[AN]
involvment in the abduction. The plot[N]
was most likely foiled during the Battle[N]
of Barhara, 760, when Velthomer was[AN]
defeated by Sigurd Chalphy. Our sources[N]
also contain more horrifying details,[N]
implicating Celice Chalphy...[AN]
Come back tomorrow to find the Chalphy[N]
dynasty's involvment in this conspiracy[N]
that incriminates the Jugdral Party.[A][X]

Celice Chalphy Exposed: Horrifc Acts[N]
Caught on Camera with Julia Velthomer[AN][Red]
We at the Askr Sun have discovered some[N]
horrific images confirming the truth[N]
in regards to those persistent rumours[AN]
regarding the Crown Prince and his[N]
sister's relationship. Turn to Page[N]
3 to see our photographic proof![AN]
Rumours about this relationship have[N]
been slowly burning for the past two[N]
decades or so. The Askr Sun's team[AN]
of high-quality investigators slipped[N]
off to the remote town of Tilnanogue[N]
in northwest Isaac to follow some[AN]
leads. The sleepy Isaacian town is a[N]
popular royal retreat for some reason,[N]
and we were determined to expose this.[AN]
In go the Prince and Princess, with[N]
Duke Chalphy preventing trespassers.[N]
But the party continued so late into[AN]
the night, the hapless Oifaye had to go[N]
to sleep. Click-click-click, concrete[N]
proof Celice Chalphy, the so-called[AN]
"Light Inheritor", is a good-for-nothing[N]
dirty scoundrel of a cheater, prefering[N]
the company of his sister, herself a[AN]
product of incest, to his actual wife.[N]
We're not quite sure if Lana knows about[N]
this yet, but you can be sure we'll have[AN]
the scoop on her reaction in tomorrow's[N]
Askr Sun. Turn to Page 5 to figure out[N]
if Celice's son has Ulir or Fala blood![A][X]

Julia Velthomer: The Inbred Airhead[N]
- The Result of Alvis's Schemes -[AN]
Despite the official government reports[N]
to the contrary, Princess Julia's true[N]
paternity lies with Duke Alvis Velthomer.[AN]
As a result, we won't use the legal fiction[N]
of "Julia Chalphy" in this article.[N]
We will use the truth of the matter.[AN]
Alvis had partaken in an incestous[N]
relationship during the 750s with his[N]
own sister, Deirdre Heim/Chalphy/[AN]
Velthomer, depending on which of her[N]
marraiges you consider to be rightful.[N]
Rumours had circulated Barhara since[AN]
the day Julia was born about the truth[N]
of things. Officially she was a single[N]
child of Sigurd and Deirdre's.[AN]
This is an utterly shameless lie. DNA[N]
tests imported from Tokyo suggest[N]
Minor Fala Holy Blood where Minor Baldo[AN]
should reside. Royal officials have yet[N]
to allow us to test Fortuna's product on[N]
Celice's son. But we at the Mirror can[AN]
confirm their absolute reliability.[N]
Itsuki Aoi, CEO, had this to say.[AN]
"Our DNA tests can detect Jugdralian Holy[N]
Blood and Fodlanese Crests in just 24 hours.[N]
It is a very quick and effective test."[AN]
We have faith in these tests, and our faith[N]
in Celice's marital fidelity to Lana Chalphy[N]
is the exact opposite. Turn the page to[AN]

Ishtar Freege and her connections[N]
to the Lopt Sect[AN]
While the Duchy of Freege passed on to[N]
Tiltyu Freege in the aftermath of the[N]
Battle of Barhara and the ensuing power[AN]
struggle, by no means did this eliminate[N]
Blume Freege from local politics.[N]
His side of the Freege family served[AN]
as a mirror to Tiltyu's. As Tiltyu[N]
married Azel Velthomer, Blume married[N]
Hilda Velthomer. Ishtore and Ishtar[AN]
are to Arthur and Tinny. Investigations[N]
into the Freege family reveal Ishtar[N]
had entered into a relationship with[AN]
Julius "Velthomer", who declared himself[N]
the Dark Lord and led an insurrection[N]
against the government in 777. While[AN]
he disappeared afterwards and the relation-[N]
ship is widely agreed to have ended,[N]
the question marks around Ishtar, and[AN]
by extension other members of the Freege[N]
clan, including her cousin Tinny and[N]
mother Hilda, remain.[A][X]

## MAFC5NewsReportDozel
[Red]-- THE MUSPELL INDEPENDENT --[Red][N]
The Dozel Clan and its Links to the[N]
War in Isaac and the 750s Crisis[AN]
The Dozel family, holding the duchy of[N]
the same name, have always held great[N]
ambition amongst its scions.[AN]
This ambition included several such[N]
acts of foul play, including various[N]
assassinations of prominent figures.[AN]
Lopt Sect involvment appears to be[N]
negative, with tactit approval from[N]
its leadership being most likely.[AN]
Evidence shows at the conclusion of[N]
the Isaac campaign, the late Duke[N]
Langbart killed Prince Kurth of[AN]
Grandbell without provocation, and[N]
then severely wounded his advisor,[N]
Byron Chalphy. A partition plan[AN]
was then drawn up between Dozel and[N]
Duke Reptor Freege, with the two[N]
houses receiving vast swathes of[AN]
territory across Jugdral. The entire[N]
kingdom of Isaac was promised to the[N]
Dozels. Indeed, this was reality for[AN]
around two years, although resistance[N]
never truly ceased. Lex Dozel, the[N]
current candidate, has no involvement[AN]
with the Isaac War. He threw his lot[N]
in with Sigurd Chalphy's band, and now[N]
sits as Duke of Dozel. However,[AN]
his late brother Dannan was firmly on[N]
the side of Langbart. His son Johan[N]
does not appear to share these views.[AN]
Still, the House of Dozel has always[N]
been an ambitious one. One can never[N]
predict which decision they will make.[A][X]

## MAFC5NewsReportEdda
[Red]-- THE NIFL TIMES --[Red][N]
Yet More Church Corruption:[N]
Bishop Denies All Charges[AN]
New revelations regarding the Church[N]
of Edda have recently come to light.[N]
In addition to profiteering from[AN]
the masses via the sales of items[N]
such as indulgences and the corrupt[N]
appointments of many clergy members,[AN]
it has been revealed that in exchange[N]
for large amounts of cash, the holy[N]
Valkyrie Staff has been used to[AN]
arbitrarily bring back those who[N]
by right should have died of various[N]
causes. While we have not been able[AN]
to confirm who has been revived and[N]
on whose orders, we at the Times[N]
consider this a grave breach of[AN]
public confidence and a surprising[N]
reversal of the finality of death.[N]
We have attempted to contact the[AN]
church to see if Bishop Claude[N]
carried out these favours personally[N]
or if his son Corple instead used[AN]
the sacred staff. A clergyman said[N]
that "The Valkyrie Staff had not[N]
been used at any point. These[AN]
allegations are completely false."[N]
Investigations into the beneficaries[N]
of the Staff's use continue.[A][X]

Slowest MP in the Parliament:[N]
Exclusive Interviews with Arden[AN]
The Jugdral Party has many candidates[N]
for the Parliament of Heroes. Today,[N]
our journalists have conducted an[AN]
interview with Sir Arden of Chalphy,[N]
a very slow figure. We were surprised[N]
to find out how slow he was...[AN]
BRUNO: So who are you, anyway?[N]
ARDEN: I'm Arden! I'm strong and[N]
I'm sturdy! Alternatively, tough![AN]
BRUNO: I was lead to believe that[N]
the third part of the Three S[N]
Standard was being slow. Correct?[AN]
ARDEN: I hate being called slow![N]
I ain't slow! I'll have you know[N]
I doubled one bandit yesterday![AN]
BRUNO: I find that hard to believe.[N]
Only those with Pursuit can strike[N]
enemies twice in this land.[AN]
ARDEN: This here's the Pursuit[N]
Ring! It gives you the Power of[N]
Pursuit! Alec hasn't teased me[AN]
once ever since I found this[N]
thing in Agustria forty-odd years[N]
ago! Times flies, doesn't it?[AN]
BRUNO: I see. This is all gibber-[N]
gabber to me, so I'll be on my way.[N]
Jugdral is in very slow hands.[AN]

out just who this "Alec" figure is.[N]
He's probably not too important.[A][X]

[Red]-- NEWS OF ASKR --[Red][N]
Jungby Border Defences in Shambles:[N]
Ruling Class Sits on its Hands[AN]
Our hired investigators sneaked into[N]
Jungby Castle and acquired some very[N]
interesting information about the[AN]
Verdanian frontier and its current[N]
handling by the Jungby border guards.[N]
Bandit threat levels are currently[AN]
quite low. Actions by King Faval and[N]
his father Jamka are currently reducing[N]
agitation amongst the bandit classes.[AN]
However, although banditry levels are[N]
currently on the decline, they have not[N]
levelled out by any definition. If Faval[AN]
suffers an inexplicable accident and the[N]
throne of Verdane lies empty, who knows[N]
what could happen? Succession is a topic[AN]
not often addressed in Verdane, for fear[N]
that Jamka's dynasty gets overthrown. The[N]
dynastic links between Verdane and Jungby[AN]
will no longer be a factor. Nobody wants[N]
to see a repeat of the abduction of Aideen[N]
Jungby and the ruin its aftermath brought[AN]
to Verdane. But if a coup is launched, aimed[N]
at dethroning Faval, Grandbell's defences[N]
are very, very thin. A second abduction in[AN]
the House of Jungby could bring royal might[N]
to bear against the Kingdom of Verdane...[N]
If they don't reach Barhara before any[AN]
mobilisation takes place. We can only hope[N]
Faval Verdane gets himself an heir soon:[N]
Grandbell or Isaac could profit otherwise.[A][X]
