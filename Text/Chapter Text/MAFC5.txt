## MAFC5MapNarration
The continent of Jugdral has seen better[N]
days. Its past glories are exactly that.[AN]
Now, the world revolves around the land of[N]
Zenith - or to be more specific,[AN]
the Kingdom of Askr. The mighty Order of[N]
Heroes, one of the most diverse militaries[AN]
to grace the planet, has imposed its will[N]
across all. And though direct Askran rule[AN]
may not yet be forced on Jugdral, it is[N]
firmly within its sphere of influence.[AN]
Regular elections to the Parliament of Heroes[N]
are held throughout Askr and beyond.[AN]
Sigurd Chalphy, head of the Jugdral Party,[N]
was once unquestionably the most powerful[AN]
figure on the continent. However, his faction[N]
proved unpopular in the corridors of power.[AN]
The Fodlan Party, headed by a certain[N]
Byleth Eisner, dominated the polls.[AN]
Jugdral's share of the vote plummeted.[N]
The General Election of 797 looms.[AN]
Will the electorate give the old Chalphy[N]
dynasty another run at power?[AN][X]

Son, the situation is truly dire.[N]
The Fodlanese are co-opting our[AN]
primary issues in the eyes of Askr.[N]
And as a result, the polls look grim.[AN]
[ML]
That blasted Constituency Commission![N]
They just had to slash the Jugdral MPs[AN]
returned by a third! The population's[N]
perfectly stable. Gerrymanderers![AN]
[MR]
Indeed. Barely any of our candidates[N]
held their seats. Doesn't help when[AN]
their old seat suddenly has a huge[N]
pocket of Hoshidan support included.[AN]
Son, call in the nephew. Thracia's[N]
in utter freefall.[AN]
[ML]
Of course.[A]
#Event here, Leaf running in?
[ML][MoveLeft]
[FL][LoadLeaf]
Freefall? That's kind. If we don't claw[N]
something back soon, the Jugdral Party[AN]
in the Thracian Peninsula is finished.[N]
The only poll-topper we have is Reinhardt.[AN]
And I don't know if he's with us or if he's[N]
with the Order of Heroes directly...[AN]
[Left]
His Senate chances are shot, though.[N]
Another sweep for the Fodlan Party...[AN]
We need to strategise. I'd love another[N]
run at it, but the odds are poor.[AN]
[MR]
Son, we need to put someone forward.[N]
If we don't field any Senate candidates,[AN]
there isn't a hope we'll take House seats.[N]
You came close last year. Celice Chalphy,[AN]
Senator for Barhara. Nice ring around it.[N]
Then you propel me in next term.[AN]
[Left]
The odds of that happening now that I've[N]
been dubbed Legendary have plummeted.[AN]
Speaking of, you absolutely should be[N]
put forward to the Legends Commission.[AN]
[FL]
I agree. If my father was still around,[N]
he'd support your bid in a heartbeat.[AN]
Are we not the three Lords of Jugdral?[N]
Two of us are Legends. Now for the third.[AN]
[MR]
The Legends, the front bench of the coalition...[N]
Now's not the time to dream of ministries.[AN]
Leaf! Bring out the campaign map![A][X]

[FL]
Grandbell's been cut down to one constituency[N]
per duchy. Each duchy has an amount[AN]
of MPs, and we need to make sure that[N]
those MPs belong to us.[AN]
Let's start here, in Barhara.[N]
Celice and Julia hold comfortable majorities.[AN]
There should be little issue defending it.[N]
Velthomer is safe for your old friend[AN]
Alvis. Cyas is clinging on by a slender[N]
margin. It might be wise to swap him[AN]
out for Azel instead and give him a run.[N]
Dozel is a problem. We hold no seats there.[AN]
Candidates can hail from wherever they please,[N]
and the main Dozel seat is held by a[AN]
certain Laslow of the Conquest Party.[N]
Lex Dozel is the obvious candidate here.[AN]
Freege is an interesting one. Honestly,[N]
I have no idea how Tiltyu is holding a seat.[AN]
Shore up her support and hold it at any cost.[N]
If you're feeling brazen, you could try[AN]
and push for another one. I am not feeling[N]
brazen.[AN]
[Left]
I'll take over for a bit, if you don't mind.[N]
Edda's a lost cause. I'm surprised Claude[N]
Riegan hasn't sailed in and took ten seats[AN]
this side of Thracia because he shares his[N]
name with the Archbishop.[AN]
Always with the Fodlan Party. Here's hoping[N]
Tinny doesn't get mad if she sees Hilda[AN]
Goneril on a Freege ballot.[N]
Either way, Chalphy. Your home constituency,[AN]
Sigurd. You're a certainty to top the poll.[N]
How about you bring in a running mate?[AN]
I owe a lot to Oifaye and he really should[N]
have been elected long ago. Bring him in![AN]
Jungby's not looking too good. Brigid is[N]
the MP for Orgahil, not Jungby.[AN]
I'd love to get dear Lana into the House,[N]
but realistically, she doesn't have a hope.[AN]
Campaign for Faval, I suppose, if you want[N]
any slim chance at taking a seat here.[AN]
[Right]
That's... not the greatest. Still, perhaps[N]
the safe seats will hold.[AN]

The Parliament has a vendetta against the[N]
Peninsula. There has to be one.[AN]
They slash its representation at every turn.[N]
No development ever gets approved there.[AN]
And we take all the blame for Askran idleness.[N]
Leaf, how's your wing of the party holding?[AN]
[MR]
To be blunt, poorly. I've a respectable[N]
amount of votes in Lenster. No other[AN]
constituencies there anymore. Just Lenster.[N]
I'm not getting any expansion here.[AN]
Just keeping Nanna and Fin in office will[N]
be miraclous. Alster's home to a lot[AN]
of Freegian MPs for some reason. Reinhardt,[N]
being the big poll-topper. Olwen, part[AN]
of the dynasty. His nemesis Kempf gets[N]
voted in as a protest vote, too.[AN]
Manster? Conote? Nothing. Sety stands[N]
for Silesia, obviously. Nobody else has[AN]
a hope. There's no more Frest constituency.[N]
Asvel isn't getting any votes in Lenster![AN]
Tahra's been drawn inside Luthecia, south[N]
of the border. What were they thinking?[AN]
Making sure there's no Linoan seat, that's[N]
what. Don't get me started on the Purple[AN]
Dragon Mountain debacle. Or perhaps I should[N]
say Mease, because that's what it's been[AN]
lumped into. I swear, that stupid fairy,[N]
I don't care what her name is, rigged it.[AN]
Rigged the election, stole the seat, you[N]
name it. That's Dagda's seat. Not the fairy's.[A][X]
