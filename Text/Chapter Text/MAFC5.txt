## MAFC5MapNarration
The continent of Jugdral has seen better[N]
days. Its past glories are exactly that.[AN]
Now, the world revolves around the land of[N]
Zenith - or to be more specific,[AN]
the Kingdom of Askr. The mighty Order of[N]
Heroes, one of the most diverse militaries[AN]
to grace the planet, has imposed its will[N]
across all. And though direct Askran rule[AN]
may not yet be forced on Jugdral, it is[N]
firmly within its sphere of influence.[AN]
Regular elections to the Parliament of Heroes[N]
are held throughout Askr and beyond.[AN]
Sigurd Chalphy, head of the Jugdral Party,[N]
was once unquestionably the most powerful[AN]
figure on the continent. However, his faction[N]
proved unpopular in the corridors of power.[AN]
The Fodlan Party, headed by a certain[N]
Byleth Eisner, dominated the polls.[AN]
Jugdral's share of the vote plummeted.[N]
The General Election of 797 looms.[AN]
Will the electorate give the old Chalphy[N]
dynasty another run at power?[AN][X]

[MR]
Again?! Why do I read the Askr Times?[N]
"According to 1,000 respondents,[AN]
48% of voters would vote for a member[N]
of the Fodlan Party. The Jugdral Party[AN]
trails at 25%. Smaller parties compose[N]
the remainder of the electorate's view."[A]
[ML]
Why are people so obsessed with that[N]
"revolution" Fodlan are promising?[AN]
The election campaign officially begins[N]
today, by the way. Advertising is now[AN]
legal. And they are dominating there.[N]
Look here, there's a list of candidates.[AN]
[MR]
Oh, how didn't I notice that? Looks to[N]
be complete and accurate for us. Not[AN]
a common trait from these Zenith papers.[N]
I believe we should go and tour the[AN]

Jugdral will be represented properly![A][X]

Son, the situation is truly dire.[N]
The Fodlanese are co-opting our[AN]
primary issues in the eyes of Askr.[N]
And as a result, the polls look grim.[AN]
[ML]
That blasted Constituency Commission![N]
They just had to slash the Jugdral MPs[AN]
returned by a third! The population's[N]
perfectly stable. Gerrymanderers![AN]
[MR]
Indeed. Barely any of our candidates[N]
held their seats. Doesn't help when[AN]
their old seat suddenly has a huge[N]
pocket of Hoshidan support included.[AN]
Son, call in the nephew. Thracia's[N]
in utter freefall.[AN]
[ML]
Of course.[A]
#Event here, Leaf running in?
[ML][MoveLeft]
[FL][LoadLeaf]
Freefall? That's kind. If we don't claw[N]
something back soon, the Jugdral Party[AN]
in the Thracian Peninsula is finished.[N]
The only poll-topper we have is Reinhardt.[AN]
And I don't know if he's with us or if he's[N]
with the Order of Heroes directly...[AN]
[Left]
His Senate chances are shot, though.[N]
Another sweep for the Fodlan Party...[AN]
We need to strategise. I'd love another[N]
run at it, but the odds are poor.[AN]
[MR]
Son, we need to put someone forward.[N]
If we don't field any Senate candidates,[AN]
there isn't a hope we'll take House seats.[N]
You came close last year. Celice Chalphy,[AN]
Senator for Barhara. Nice ring around it.[N]
Then you propel me in next term.[AN]
[Left]
The odds of that happening now that I've[N]
been dubbed Legendary have plummeted.[AN]
Speaking of, you absolutely should be[N]
put forward to the Legends Commission.[AN]
[FL]
I agree. If my father was still around,[N]
he'd support your bid in a heartbeat.[AN]
Are we not the three Lords of Jugdral?[N]
Two of us are Legends. Now for the third.[AN]

# CG: constituency maps?
[FL][LoadLeaf]
[Left][LoadCelice]
[Right][LoadSigurd]
[FL]
Grandbell's been cut down to one constituency[N]
per duchy. Each duchy has an amount[AN]
of MPs, and we need to make sure that[N]
those MPs belong to us.[AN]
Let's start here, in Barhara.[N]
Celice and Julia hold comfortable majorities.[AN]
There should be little issue defending it.[N]
Velthomer is safe for your old friend[AN]
Alvis. Cyas is clinging on by a slender[N]
margin. It might be wise to swap him[AN]
out for Azel instead and give him a run.[N]
Dozel is a problem. We hold no seats there.[AN]
Candidates can hail from wherever they please,[N]
and the main Dozel seat is held by a[AN]
certain Laslow of the Conquest Party.[N]
Lex Dozel is the obvious candidate here.[AN]
Freege is an interesting one. Honestly,[N]
I have no idea how Tiltyu is holding a seat.[AN]
Shore up her support and hold it at any cost.[N]
If you're feeling brazen, you could try[AN]
and push for another one. I am not feeling[N]
brazen.[AN]
[Left]
I'll take over for a bit, if you don't mind.[N]
Edda's a lost cause. I'm surprised Claude[N]
Riegan hasn't sailed in and took ten seats[AN]
this side of Thracia because he shares his[N]
name with the Archbishop.[AN]
Always with the Fodlan Party. Here's hoping[N]
Tinny doesn't get mad if she sees Hilda[AN]
Goneril on a Freege ballot.[N]
Either way, Chalphy. Your home constituency,[AN]
Sigurd. You're a certainty to top the poll.[N]
How about you bring in a running mate?[AN]
I owe a lot to Oifaye and he really should[N]
have been elected long ago. Bring him in![AN]
Jungby's not looking too good. Brigid is[N]
the MP for Orgahil, not Jungby.[AN]
I'd love to get dear Lana into the House,[N]
but realistically, she doesn't have a hope.[AN]
Campaign for Faval, I suppose, if you want[N]
any slim chance at taking a seat here.[AN]
[Right]
That's... not the greatest. Still, perhaps[N]
the safe seats will hold.[AN]

The Parliament has a vendetta against the[N]
Peninsula. There has to be one.[AN]
They slash its representation at every turn.[N]
No development ever gets approved there.[AN]
And we take all the blame for Askran idleness.[N]
Leaf, how's your wing of the party holding?[AN]
[MR]
To be blunt, poorly. I've a respectable[N]
amount of votes in Lenster. No other[AN]
constituencies there anymore. Just Lenster.[N]
I'm not getting any expansion here.[AN]
Just keeping Nanna and Fin in office will[N]
be miraclous. Alster's home to a lot[AN]
of Freegian MPs for some reason. Reinhardt,[N]
being the big poll-topper. Olwen, part[AN]
of the dynasty. His nemesis Kempf gets[N]
voted in as a protest vote, too.[AN]
Manster? Conote? Nothing. Sety stands[N]
for Silesia, obviously. Nobody else has[AN]
a hope. There's no more Frest constituency.[N]
Asvel isn't getting any votes in Lenster![AN]
Tahra's been drawn inside Luthecia, south[N]
of the border. What were they thinking?[AN]
Making sure there's no Linoan seat, that's[N]
what. Don't get me started on the Purple[AN]
Dragon Mountain debacle. Or perhaps I should[N]
say Mease, because that's what it's been[AN]
lumped into. I swear, that stupid fairy,[N]
I don't care what her name is, rigged it.[AN]

My brother has served for some time,[N]
so he's confident he can get me in.[AN]
[Right]
Ah, Lord Alvis of Velthomer...[N]
It only makes sense for Azel[AN]

together for now. You have my[AN]

and getting one for Azel as well.[AN]
[FL]
You have my thanks, Sigurd. Alvis[N]
Velthomer and Azel Velthomer.[AN]
Those are the names that shall be[N]
voted No. 1 and No. 2.[AN]
I hear Bishop Cyas is carving a bit[N]
of a name for himself in Thracia.[AN]
Not a word to the public, but since[N]
he is my son, I should help him...[AN]

Oh, hi there! I'm doing just fine,[N]

But to be fair, it's quite a narrow[N]

We currently lack any Dozel seats.[AN]

And it's damned irritating, too.[N]
I get denied office by the slimmest[AN]

a vendetta against the axe knight.[AN]
So I'm gonna show the Parliament[N]
what's what by having two axe knights[AN]
on the ballot. Nephew Johan's not the[N]

[FL]
There's nothing in this world more[N]
beautiful than my beloved Lakche![AN]
The public will vote for me in droves![N]
Such romance will prove irresistible![AN]
[FR]
Do I point out that they're cousins?[N]
I don't think the public would approve.[AN]
[Right]
They would not. Blood purity is of no[N]
concern. In fact, it may hamper the[AN]
health of the descendants of those[N]
within a relationship between those[AN]
closely related. Perhaps I should[N]
opt to campaign against such acts.[A]
[Left]
That's a dangerous promise to make.[N]
I've no qualm with anti-incest laws.[AN]
It's strictly forbidden, for obvious[N]
reasons, after all. But cousins[AN]
within the nobility wedding is still[N]
a fairly frequent occurance. If you[AN]
make taking a stand against incest,[N]
untold controversies - rebellions[AN]
in the party, even - may occur.[N]
Hypocrisy within the Party's upper[AN]

Sigurd Chalphy: The Greatest Warmonger[N]
in the 8th Century G.C.[AN]
Lord Chalphy has many titles. Duke of[N]
Chalphy. King of Grandbell. Indeed,[N]
there was a time he could have pushed[AN]
to become Emperor of Jugdral. And he[N]
went about this by burning Jugdral to[N]
ashes. Agustria remembers well the[AN]
devestation wrought upon it by Chalphy's[N]
army. The old nobility was decimated.[N]
Two decades of instability? Chalphy.[AN]
Take Verdane. A better statesman would[N]
have negotiated with King Batou during[N]
the Aideen Jungby abduction scandal.[AN]
But he did not wait. He instantly[N]
waged war without any thought for the[N]
consequences. And those consequences?[AN]
Verdane is still utterly deprived after[N]
that brutal, savage war. Their king is[N]
the son of a shameless collaborator[AN]
that joined the Chalphy army, though[N]
he is still of the royal line. This was[N]
entirely Chalphy's fault.[AN]

Alvis Velthomer: Secret Links to the[N]
Evil Sect of Loputousu[AN]
When one thinks of the Duke of Velthomer,[N]
they tend to think of a stern, imposing[N]
man. A man with high ideals, but with[AN]
few scruples when it comes to what he[N]
believes to be the "greater good".[N]
According to a man known as Galle XVIII,[AN]
Velthomer has gone to extreme lengths[N]
to bring about his ideal world. Our[N]
source claims this to have started during[AN]
the instability of the 750s. Working[N]
in collaboration with a figure known as[N]
"Archbishop Manfloy", the pair orchestrated[AN]
a cunning scheme to resurrect the evil[N]
Earth Dragon Loputousu, along with other[N]
members of the Lopt Sect. During his[AN]
tenure as King of Grandbell, he had wed[N]
now-Queen Deirdre Heim. Interviews with[N]
King Shanan Isaac confirm Manfloy's[AN]
involvment in the abduction. The plot[N]
was most likely foiled during the Battle[N]
of Barhara, 760, when Velthomer was[AN]
defeated by Sigurd Chalphy. Our sources[N]
also contain more horrifying details,[N]
implicating Celice Chalphy...[AN]

Rumours about this relationship have[N]

and we were determined to expose this.[AN]
In go the Prince and Princess, with[N]

But the party continued so late into[AN]

paternity lies with Duke Alvis Velthomer.[AN]
As a result, we won't use the legal fiction[N]
of "Julia Chalphy" in this article.[N]
We will use the truth of the matter.[AN]
Alvis had partaken in an incestous[N]
relationship during the 750s with his[N]

Velthomer, depending on which of her[N]

Rumours had circulated Barhara since[AN]
the day Julia was born about the truth[N]
of things. Officially she was a single[N]
child of Sigurd and Deirdre's.[AN]
This is an utterly shameless lie. DNA[N]
tests imported from Tokyo suggest[N]
Minor Fala Holy Blood where Minor Baldo[AN]
should reside. Royal officials have yet[N]
to allow us to test Fortuna's product on[N]
Celice's son. But we at the Mirror can[AN]
confirm their absolute reliability.[N]
Itsuki Aoi, CEO, had this to say.[AN]
"Our DNA tests can detect Jugdralian Holy[N]
Blood and Fodlanese Crests in just 24 hours.[N]
It is a very quick and effective test."[AN]

The Dozel Clan and its Links to the[N]
War in Isaac and the 750s Crisis[AN]
The Dozel family, holding the duchy of[N]
the same name, have always held great[N]
ambition amongst its scions.[AN]
This ambition included several such[N]
acts of foul play, including various[N]
assassinations of prominent figures.[AN]
Lopt Sect involvment appears to be[N]
negative, with tactit approval from[N]
its leadership being most likely.[AN]
Evidence shows at the conclusion of[N]
the Isaac campaign, the late Duke[N]
Langbart killed Prince Kurth of[AN]
Grandbell without provocation, and[N]
then severely wounded his advisor,[N]
Byron Chalphy. A partition plan[AN]
was then drawn up between Dozel and[N]
Duke Reptor Freege, with the two[N]
houses receiving vast swathes of[AN]
territory across Jugdral. The entire[N]
kingdom of Isaac was promised to the[N]
Dozels. Indeed, this was reality for[AN]
around two years, although resistance[N]
never truly ceased. Lex Dozel, the[N]
current candidate, has no involvement[AN]
with the Isaac War. He threw his lot[N]
in with Sigurd Chalphy's band, and now[N]
sits as Duke of Dozel. However,[AN]
his late brother Dannan was firmly on[N]
the side of Langbart. His son Johan[N]
does not appear to share these views.[AN]
Still, the House of Dozel has always[N]
been an ambitious one. One can never[N]

In addition to profiteering from[AN]
the masses via the sales of items[N]
such as indulgences and the corrupt[N]

it has been revealed that in exchange[N]

reversal of the finality of death.[N]
We have attempted to contact the[AN]
church to see if Bishop Claude[N]
carried out these favours personally[N]
or if his son Corple instead used[AN]
the sacred staff. A clergyman said[N]
that "The Valkyrie Staff had not[N]

interesting information about the[AN]
Verdanian frontier and its current[N]
handling by the Jungby border guards.[N]
Bandit threat levels are currently[AN]
quite low. Actions by King Faval and[N]
his father Jamka are currently reducing[N]
agitation amongst the bandit classes.[AN]
However, although banditry levels are[N]
currently on the decline, they have not[N]

throne of Verdane lies empty, who knows[N]
what could happen? Succession is a topic[AN]
not often addressed in Verdane, for fear[N]

to see a repeat of the abduction of Aideen[N]
Jungby and the ruin its aftermath brought[AN]
to Verdane. But if a coup is launched, aimed[N]
at dethroning Faval, Grandbell's defences[N]
are very, very thin. A second abduction in[AN]
the House of Jungby could bring royal might[N]
to bear against the Kingdom of Verdane...[N]

#Going to default to Sigurd maintaining the old order
Are you insane?! What have you done![N]
It's only on the grace of Narga that[AN]

I have it on record that your Edelgard[AN]

positions do the party leaders hold?[AN][Clear]
[ML]
Fodlan has long been at war. Tensions[N]

have been left homeless from the war.[AN]
Events such as the so-called "javelins[N]

[MR]
#Tear into Byleth for grooming by default
Care to repeat that statement,[N]
Professor Eisner?[A]
[ML]
Of course. My wife, Dorothea, was born[N]
on the streets of Enbarr. Hence, people[AN]
like her deserve all the help they can[N]
get in life. What about it, Chalphy?[AN]
[MR]
I knew it. I knew it! Byleth Eisner.[N]
In the student body of Garreg Mach,[AN]
Class of 1179-80 Fodlan Calendar,[N]
there was a young girl, about 18 or[AN]
so. She came from nothing. Yet her[N]
voice carried her onto Enbarr's[AN]
opera circuit, the Mittlefrank[N]
Company, if we're being specific.[AN]
A favour here and there, buttering[N]
up some of the old nobility there.[AN]
Before you know it, she's a Black[N]
Eagle in the Officers' Academy.[AN]
[ML]
Mr. Chalphy, this is completely[N]
inappropriate. What does Dorothea[AN]
have to do with my politics? Do[N]
I tear you apart because of your[AN]
beloved Deirdre? Deirdre Heim?[N]
Deirdre Chalphy? Deirdre Velthomer?[AN]
Oh, how does Jugdral stand with[N]
such confusion floating about?[AN]
[Left][LoadAnna]
I'm inclined to concur. Please cease[N]

return to debating about the policy[N]
your party has on housing.[AN]
#Back down if you're a coward.
#Sigurd's no coward.
[MR]
Mrs. Anna, this is not a matter of[N]
policy. This is a matter of exposing[AN]
Mr. Eisner for who he really is.[N]
Jugdral must know the rotten depths[AN]
of his character.[Left][Clear][MR] The details of Mr.[N]
Eisner's teaching assignment are not[AN]
clear. But records do detail that at[N]
some point in 1180, a Ms. Arnault[AN]
transferred to a Mr. Eisner's class.[N]
This is a girl with nothing to her[AN]
name. Yet you continued to groom her.[N]
Helpless to do anything against you.[AN]
Teachers and students must not form[N]
intimate relationships. It is wrong.[AN]
[ML]
There was no intimacy at Garreg Mach.[N]
Any rumours suggesting such are lies.[AN]
She just preferred my tutelage over[N]
Professor Essar's. I fail to see any[AN]
issue with that. The worst that could[N]
have happened was her being my pet.[AN]
Is playing favourites a crime now?[N]
All teachers have teacher's pets.[AN]
[MR]
Right, the teacher's pet... One thing[N]
leads to another, and before you[AN]
know it, you wed in the flames of war.[N]
Why does the teacher marry the student?[AN]
[ML]
We hadn't seen each other in five years.[N]
I was 26, she was 23. That's only a[AN]
three year difference! There was no power[N]
disparity. We love each other. We've no[AN]
blood relation. What should stop us, Mr.[N]
Chalphy. Give me one good reason.[AN]
[MR]
You, Byleth Eisner, took a young girl[N]
from the slums. You pulled strings[AN]
amongst Adrestria's nobility to get her[N]
into Garreg Mach. Dorothea Arnault,[AN]
the only commoner in the Black Eagles?[N]
This reeks of exploitation. You transfer[AN]
her into your class. You dote on her,[N]
sharing many a meal in the canteen.[AN]
You promise her safety, security. Yet[N]
you manipulated the vulnerable girl[AN]
from the lowest levels of society. Now[N]
she can only depend on you. Even after[AN]
years apart your old student body call[N]
you Professor. Your grooming advances.[AN]
Blood spills on Gronder Field. Some old[N]
classmates get slain in foolish combat.[AN]
Poor Dorothea turns to you for comfort.[N]
One thing turns to another. Before you[AN]
know it, Dorothea Arnault becomes Dorothea[N]
Eisner. The grooming process is complete.[AN]
And I doubt Dorothea was the only victim.[N]
You made overtures to many students at[AN]
that corrupt academy, holding a title[N]
simply due to your relation to Seiros.[AN]
[ML]
Seiros was a wicked woman. Had I have[N]
known the truth then, I would never[AN]

time ago. A mess that you helped[AN]
to cause! Running off, madly in love[N]
with what appeared to be a simple[AN]
girl from the forest. Oh, the ruin[N]
you brought your homeland! If you[AN]
failed to defy destiny at Barhara,[N]
we likely wouldn't be here today.[AN]
Not like that would stop your son.[N]
Celice Chalphy was always fascinated[AN]
with his sister Julia. Too much so.[N]
Siblings being close is hardly[AN]
out of the ordinary. But they were[N]
too close altogether. Growing up[AN]
together doesn't result in this.[N]
So, what triggered these urges?[A]
[MR]
Was it you? Did one of your party[N]
members spin this latest wave of[AN]
rumours about my son's alleged[N]
affairs with Julia? You're low.[AN]
Utterly bankrupt. You smear my[N]
wife, you smear my son.[AN]
What's next, you smear my country?[N]
Cease these evil lies, scum.[AN]
[ML]
You spewed no shortage of malice[N]
at my family. Yours are far more[AN]
corrupt. About 20 years ago, they[N]
slipped off to a remote Isaacian[AN]
village. Tilnanogue, or some such?[N]
Celice and Julia vanish from[AN]
Barhara. Nobody knows where. But it[N]
is obvious what they did. We don't[AN]
need to know the details. But the[N]
penchant for incestuous relations[AN]
in the female line of Heim is strong.[N]
Such a dynasty has no right to rule![AN]
[MR]
Deirdre had her memory wiped during[N]
that whole ordeal! She didn't even[AN]
know that Alvis was her brother.[N]
You can't spin that against her![AN]
[ML]
This is a nobility consumed with[N]
incest at every turn. Usually it[AN]
just amounts to cousin marraiges.[N]
But Celice Chalphy engages in[AN]
frequent acts with his own sister![N]
In spite of his nominal marraige![AN]
Does poor Lana Jungby think herself[N]
a proper replacement for Julia?[AN]
[MR]
Silence! My son is not an adulterer.[N]
He's always been fond of Lana since[AN]
they were children. He would never[N]
leave her for his own sister, of all[AN]
people! She has had many things happen[N]
to her. But relations with her brother[AN]
do not fall under that umbrella! Cease[N]
your lying. We do not condone incest.[AN]
You are nothing more than a hypocrite.[N]
These ancient rumours are all false.[AN]
[ML]
We'll see about that. Proof will soon[N]
come out revealing Celice's true[AN]
crimes. Incestuous relations with[N]
Julia "Chalphy". Cheating on his[AN]
wife, Lana "Chalphy". Collusion[N]
with an unspeakable amount of[AN]
officials. The only place for him[N]
is prison. If democracy holds[AN]
true, no Senate seats will ever[N]
grace your dynasty. And may you[AN]
all lose seats in Parliament.[N]
Farewell, he who was cuckolded![A]
[MR]
That Eisner... He has to be Sect.[N]
There's no other possibility.[A][X]

## MAFC5GreatDebateTomorrow
[MR][LoadSigurd][ML][LoadDeirdre]
So, the debate is almost here.[N]
Are you feeling nervous, Sigurd?[AN]
[MR]
Very, my love. I don't have the[N]
confidence to beat Byleth and[AN]
his followers at the polls. Even[N]
if Byleth doesn't resonate,[AN]
some other influential Fodlanese[N]
candidate will instead. Disagree[AN]
with the Edelgard wing? Vote for[N]
the Dimitri wing. Honestly, that[AN]
coalition looks very vulnerable.[N]
But I can't split it up tomorrow.[AN]
It's too close to the election.[N]
I must strike for the head. But[AN]
with what? Byleth must have some[N]
weakness. Oh, the days of old...[A]
[ML]
Sigurd. You can't just invade an[N]
entire continent just because[AN]
you feel they are threatening[N]
you. That is not tolerated.[A]
[MR]
I know, Deirdre. I know. Diplomacy[N]
was never my strong point. I am[AN]
a knight at heart. We fight, not[N]
talk. But talk it out, I must.[A][X]

[ML]
Hilda! What's taking you? You[N]
know what Teach wants us here[AN]
for. Heh, Teach. Been a long[N]
time since I called him that...[A]
[MR]
Yes, I know Byleth ordered us to[N]
keep an eye on Jugdral. Flying[AN]
on a dragon beats walking, at least.[N]
I hear there's a big Hilda here[AN]
too. But she's an awful disgrace[N]
of a woman. She's hideous![AN]
[ML]
All the more reason to attack[N]
the Jugdral Party. I've been[AN]
running Almyra with trick after[N]
trick, and you've cleaned up[AN]
whenever things go wrong. We're[N]
smarter than that old crone.[AN]
[MR]
There's a Claude here, too. Head[N]
of the Church of Edda, Jugdral's[AN]
version of the Church of Seiros.[N]
Not that you ever cared about it.[AN]
[ML]
Fodlan doesn't miss Seiros. Spread[N]
the revolution, the party line says...[A][X]

[ML]
Byleth! Welcome to Jugdral. Does it take[N]
your fancy? I've been listening in[AN]
to things here and there. Figuring out[N]
who was loyal to who, digging up some[AN]
potential controversies, all that kind[N]
of stuff. So, what's going on Page 1?[A]
[MR]
Hm... Well, these plans are sneaky.[N]
Perfect. I asked you for a reason,[AN]
Claude. Jugdral is rife with division.[N]
You're telling me the heir to the[AN]
throne is, ahem, attracted to his sister.[N]
Ugh, the thought of it is sickening...[AN]
[ML]
Sickening indeed. But I've done a deal[N]
with the Askr Sun. We give them a hefty[AN]
dose of cash and some pictures to work[N]
with, and they handle the rest. Sigurd[AN]
Chalphy and his party will crumble with[N]
the controversy. Ahaha... Ahaha![AN]
Here's how we handle the pictures. First,[N]
we need a reasonable resemblence to...[AN][X]

## MAFC5BylethDeparts
[ML][LoadByleth][MR][LoadDorothea]
When you think about it, Holy Blood[N]
isn't all that different from the[AN]
Crests we all know. I don't believe[N]
the people are satisfied with the[AN]
status quo. But who would be the[N]
Edelgard of Jugdral?[A]
[ML]
From what I can tell, nobody. Holy[N]
Blood is considered a universal[AN]
good thing on this continent, the[N]
Twelve Crusaders borderline godly.[AN]
The only threats to the Crusaders'[N]
order, the Lopt Sect...[AN]
[MR]
Just as the Slithers and Edelgard[N]
had to work together... despite[AN]
everything they did to her. I hear[N]
there is a kingdom ruled by those[AN]
lacking Holy Blood to the southwest.[N]
The Kingdom of Verdane, it's called.[AN]
[ML]
Dorothea, that hasn't been the case[N]
for quite a while. But that doesn't[AN]
prevent that from being a prime area[N]
to campaign. Hostility to those with[AN]
Crusader heritage would be quite likely.[N]
Besides, I hear the fishing's good.[A][X]

[ML]
Byleth Eisner, the Ashen Demon...[N]
He seems... off. Wrong.[A]
[MR]
Indeed. He seems utterly corrupt.[N]
Far too young to be a "professor".[AN]
I am led to believe he was granted[N]
the job title he claims by his...[AN]
Oh, I've no idea how this connects.[N]
But Eisner and Seiros are relatives.[AN]
Perhaps I should get someone to find[N]
some more dirt on Byleth.[AN]
But is stooping to the Fodlanese's[N]
level the right thing to do?[A][X]

## MAFC5BylethDepartsSnoop

Do I get investigators on Byleth?[N]

## MAFC5WeekToTheDebate

[MR]
So, there's a week left until the[N]
so-called Great Debate. How are[AN]
the people of Grandbell treating[N]
you? Thracia is ruthless for me.[A]
[ML]
Better, but not by much: lots of[N]
people don't consider us relevant.[AN]
We're old, remnants of a bygone era.[N]
Fodlan stands for change, progress.[AN]
Older voters still support us, but[N]
the young are a tough sell. If the[AN]
younger wing of the Party such as you[N]
and I are failing to do well...[AN]
[MR]
Then the older generation is even[N]
less likely to do well. Does your[AN]
father have his debate topics lined[N]
up yet? Policy is a big deal.[AN]
[ML]
Not yet, I'm afraid. He's searching[N]
for the hammer blow that will shatter[AN]
the mask of Fodlan and lay bare the[N]
face of a murderous tyrant.[AN]
[MR]
Harsh words, Celice. But perhaps they[N]
are warranted. Can't go five seconds[AN]
without finding some smear in the[N]
newspapers. Zenith has monopolised the[AN]
media, I swear... How did they pull[N]
that off? A market failure indeed.[AN]
[ML]
Are you just here to say hello or are[N]
you going to give us a hand canvassing?[AN]
[MR]
Neither: I've got some information.[N]
Vague information, though. I hear[AN]
the media has a huge smear campaign[N]
against you planned. You have to[AN]
foil it soon: if it gets published,[N]
your run as an MP will come to a halt.[A][X]
